    <h1>John Baskerville</h1>
    <h2>Letter Founder & Master Printer</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">John Baskerville (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included <i>japanning</i> and <i>papier-mâché</i>; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>
          <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>askerville was born in the village of Wolvery, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville printed works for the Universtiry of Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted for the most federal government publishing.</p>
        
        <p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

                "Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them.  I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion."<br><cite>-John Baskerville, preface to Milton, 1758 (Anatomy of a Typeface)</cite></blockquote>
